I moved to Uppsala on 8 Jan, 2009. The main reason for this move was medical, but SF played a significant role in motivating me to choose Uppsala over my other possibilities, Helsingfors and Leuven.  In 2003 I read some quite complementary words about the SF scene in Sweden. They were written by Ken MacLeod, a person whom I admire very much. Since I've mentioned this text to Upsalafans and Uppsala philosophers many times, I decided this morning to <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/2003/08/seeing-mars-from-uppsala-ive-recently.html">display it here</a>. It's from Ken's excellent blog, but has appeared in other places as well.
