One of my first discoveries in the world of British Science Fiction was the sophisticated website of Keith Brooke and Nick Gevers, <a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/">Infinity Plus</a>. I liked it so much that I contacted Keith to express my appreciation. We have been in touch since then. The site was online from 1997 to 2006, and became a chief resource for reviews of the best in speculative fiction, as well as high-level articles and interviews. It is now an archive that is well-worth perusing and supporting by donation. Keith is a well-known British SF author, academic, running enthusiast, IT specialist, and most recently seller of ebooks. <a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/books/">His store is here.</a>
